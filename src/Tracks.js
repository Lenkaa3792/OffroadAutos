          <h4>Moab on the Go</h4>
          <p>
            Moab, Utah, offers a wide variety of trail systems, each exciting in
            its own way, with stunning views of natural rock arches, mesas,
            canyons, and the Colorado River plunging below dizzying heights. But
            for a challenge, nothing quite beats the Moab Rim Trail. The nearly
            eight miles of trail is recommended for hikers, bicyclists and
            four-wheel drive vehicles only. The first mile has a higher density
            of obstacles than any of the area’s other off-road trails. It’s a
            viciously long climb over bedrock that erosion has broken into
            uneven steps and ledges.s.

          <h4>Fordyce Creek Trail</h4>
          <p>
            Overlooked and all but forgotten, the Fordyce Creek Trail is
            situated not far from the world-famous Rubicon. Experienced users
            insist it’s actually a more difficult and technical trail, with six
            river crossings that will drown out anything less than 35-inch
            tires; that’s when the water is at a low ebb! When the water is
            high, 44-inch tires won’t even get you across.
