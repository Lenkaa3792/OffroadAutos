            While the majority of off-roading vehicles on this list are all
            about hitting trails, the F-150 Raptor is more interested in
            high-speed off-roading. Thatâ€™s why it comes with a 450-horsepower
            twin-turbocharged V6 engine and Fox Racing dampers that offer 13
            inches of travel in the front and 13.9 inches at the rear.

            The Land Rover Defender nameplate for the 2020 model year has been
            resurrected, bringing back one of the most capable off-roaders ever
            envisioned in a modern luxury vehicle. While the Defender might not
            have a body-on-frame setup or solid axles, the SUV can still go
            anywhere and do anything.{" "}
